* How We Classified Burn Images

| Type of Burn | Blistering | Appearance | Pinprick test |
|-----|-----|------|---|
| Superficial dermal | Present | Bright red | Sensitive to pain |
| Partial thickness | Blisters are broken | Cream colored | Dullness to pain |
| Full thickness | Absent | Gray/white | No sensation |

### A. Superficial Burn
* injury to the epidermal layer of the skin
* heals within 5 to 7 days
* e.g. sunburn
* blistering present, bright red appearance, sensitive to pain

### B. Partial Thickness Burn
* damage extends up to dermis layer
* severity depends on how much injury the dermis has sustained
* usually leave scars
* blisters are broken, cream colored, dullness to pain

### C. Full Thickness Burn
* destroys epidermis, dermis, and subcataneous layers of skin
* no sensation
* require skin grafts
* blistering absent, gray/white appearance, no sensation

# Burn Treatments
### A. Superficial Burn
1. This burn only affects the top layer of skin. 
2. If it is more than 3 inches in area on skin, or if it is on a major joint, including knee, foot, ankle, shoulder, elbow, forearm, or spine, seek a doctor as soon as possible. 
3. Soak the wound in cool water for five minutes or longer. 
4. Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief. 
5. Apply aloe vera or soothing cream to soothe the skin.
6. Wrap loose gauze to protect the affected area from infections.
7. Use antibiotic ointment and apply on the burn.
8. Within 7-10 days, the entire burn will heal without scarring. 

### B. Partial Thickness Burn
1. This burn affects beyond the top layer of skin, causing blisters and causing the area to become sore. 
2. If the blisters are severe, seek a doctor as soon as possible, as skin grafting may be required.
3. Seek medical attention immediately if burn affects the face, hands, or feet.
4. Run the affected skin under cool water for fifteen minutes or longer. 
5. Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief.
6. Use antibiotic ointment and apply on the burn.
7. Wrap gauze properly around the wound to prevent infections. 
8. Most heal without scarring from two to three weeks, but some take longer than three weeks. 

### C. Full Thickness Burn
1. This burn extends through every layer of skin. There is a white and dark brown color, and blisters do not develop. 
2. If there is no pain felt, there could be nerve damage. 
3. Make sure there is no clothing stuck to the burn. 
4. Raise the injury above your heart. 
5. Do not touch the burn and call 911 immediately.
6. There is no timeline for healing, and there will be severe scarring and contracture.
